These are some Java codes which i practiced and wrote by myself for company interview preparations.
If you want run these in your cmd, perform following commands in cmd:

javac FileName.java
java Filename

Otherwise if you are running in VSDC or anyother text editor/ide just open the .java files and run them.
I hope it helps you!
Thank You:)
